# Ranking-system-using-XGBoost-Library

The key objectives of this repository is to learn how to train and evaluate a non-trivial
machine learning model. More specifically, the task is called “learning-to-rank”. It 
consists of a set of training features that contain the relevance labels 0 (not relevant),
1 (partially relevant) and 2 (relevant), for a large set of query-document pairs. The
task is to research this problem and demonstrate a suitable solution, train a model, and produce a
result file from a training set that will be scored using standard evaluation measures in
Information Retrieval.
If you are unfamiliar with IR, you might want to look through the book '''Learning to
Rank for Information Retrieval by Tie-Yan Liu''' , which is readily available online
